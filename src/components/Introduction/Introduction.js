        <h2>Use this service to:</h2>
        <p>Exchange your car for mobility credits.</p>
        <p>This process takes around 15 minutes.</p>

        <h2>About mobility credits</h2>
        <p>If you exchange your car for mobility credits, you will receive mobility credits on a card that you can use to spend on transport that you can use instead of your car.</p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete the application form</li>
          <li>We send you a {provider} card with £100 on it, and a Swift card</li>
          <li>We collect your car</li>
          <li>We top up your {provider} card with the rest of your mobility credits</li>
          <li>Spend your credits</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What you will receive</h2>
        <p>When you sign up for mobility credits, you'll receive two cards.</p>

        <p>The {provider} card is just like a debit card, but you can only use it to pay for transport services. This card will have your personal mobility credits balance on it.
</p>
        <p>We'll also send you a Swift card valid for travel on the bus, train or tram in the West Midlands for one week, to get you started. If you'd like to use the Swift card again, you can <a href="https://www.networkwestmidlands.com/tickets/#/">buy a season ticket</a> with your {provider} card.</p>


        <h2 id="services-you-can-spend-mobility-credits-on">Services you can spend mobility credits on</h2>
